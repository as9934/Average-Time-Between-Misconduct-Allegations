# Average Time Between Misconduct Allegations

This script takes a csv file containing a list of badge numbers (or another unique police identifiers) and dates of the allegations of misconduct and outputs a csv computing the average time between allegations.

This was created to support reporting on police misconduct for <i>The Dallas Morning News</i>. The data are not included here as the reporting is ongoing.
